📊 Real-Time Intelligence with Microsoft Fabric  
This repository showcases hands-on implementations and solutions derived from the Microsoft Learn exercise: Explore Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence. The exercise focuses on leveraging Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence capabilities to ingest, process, and visualize streaming data.

🚀 Project Overview  
In this project, we've:

Ingested Streaming Data: Utilized Microsoft Fabric's Event Stream to capture real-time data.  
Stored Data Efficiently: Implemented Eventhouse and KQL Databases to manage and store the streaming data.  
Processed Data: Applied KQL queries to transform and analyze the incoming data streams.  
Visualized Insights: Created Real-Time Dashboards and Power BI reports to display live data insights.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Microsoft Fabric: A unified analytics platform for real-time data processing.  
Event Stream: For real-time data ingestion.  
Eventhouse: To store and manage streaming data.  
KQL (Kusto Query Language): For querying and analyzing data.  
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and reports.

📌 Features

Real-Time Data Ingestion: Seamlessly stream data into Microsoft Fabric.
